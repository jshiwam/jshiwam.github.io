Welcome to my website! I am Shiwam Jaiswal. I like engineering related stuff, you would find most of my projects in the porfolio section [here](https://jshiwam.github.io/). I am good at working on both solo and team projects. If you are working on something that you think is really cool, [connect with me on linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shiwam-jaiswal-7b5718165/), I might want to collaborate.

I also like working on Open Source Projects that I find really interesting. Some of the opensource repos I have contributed to are [OpenCV](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/commits?author=jshiwam), [Signoz](https://github.com/signoz/signoz/commits?author=jshiwam), [cpy3](https://github.com/go-python/cpy3/pull/21)

Currently I am working on my own open source project, that is a successor of [cpy3](https://github.com/go-python/cpy3). More info [here](https://github.com/jshiwam/cpy3x)

I was a software engineer at [BLACKROCK](https://www.blackrock.com/corporate/about-us) where I helped build a scalable QC Platform in Golang/CGO and Python/CPython.
